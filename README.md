### 🧠 MindCompass — Multi-Agent Well-Being Resource Navigator & Micro-Coach
A safe, non-diagnostic, multi-agent well-being assistant designed to help users navigate emotional overwhelm, stress, low focus, or everyday struggles—while staying ethical, resource-oriented, and safety-compliant.

MindCompass is built using multi-agent orchestration, lightweight memory, and an optional Gradio/Streamlit chat UI.

### 🧩 Multi-Agent Architecture

MindCompass Multi-Agent Orchestration — System Description

MindCompass follows a structured, safety-first multi-agent workflow that processes user messages in a controlled, ethical, and highly modular pipeline. Each agent is responsible for a distinct cognitive task, enabling the system to remain predictable, explainable, safe, and non-diagnostic.

The overall interaction begins with a user query and flows through a series of lightweight agents:

### 🔹 MindCompass Multi-Agent Workflow (Short Summary)

- **Safety Agent**  
  Screens user messages for crisis or self-harm signals and redirects to emergency help if needed.

- **Emotion Agent**  
  Extracts emotional cues (stress, overwhelm, sadness, focus issues) without performing any diagnosis.

- **Micro-Coach Agent**  
  Provides safe, practical 1–2 minute micro-actions (breathing, grounding, reflection prompts).

- **Resource Navigator**  
  Maps user needs to trusted, pre-verified well-being resources.

- **Plan Generator**  
  Creates an optional personalized 7-day micro-well-being plan.

- **Orchestrator**  
  Coordinates all agents and produces the final, clean, supportive response.


The diagram below illustrates the complete, step-by-step orchestration that powers MindCompass.
